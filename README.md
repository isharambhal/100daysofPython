# 100 Days of Code: Python JourneyðŸš€


Hello!ðŸ‘‹ This repository is a collection of my progress and learnings as I embark on the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Angela Yu ([https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=OF83024F](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)). After recently learning Git and GitHub through CodeWithHarry's YouTube videos, I was inspired to start this repository to track my daily coding journey and stay motivated.ðŸ¥°

Throughout these 100 days, I'll be:

- Solving Python challenges
- Building real-world projects
- Enhancing my programming skills one step at a time
